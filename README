There are a couple of schools of thoughts for what decides a game. While some sleepless nights, I pondered my previous games and how they are different from the games I play today. Nowadays, I feel like I have visualized the amount of pieces fall onto a certain square, and how games are decided are on specific squares rather than abstract movements.

Here in this, we will go test these hypotheses.

- Space based. Incentivize maximizing the amount of space to take in a position.
- Stack based. Incentivize maximizing the amount of pieces on specific squares
